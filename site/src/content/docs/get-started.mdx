OctoGuide checks that contributor activity on your GitHub repository aligns with common expectations of smoothly-running projects.
It will automatically post friendly comments when contributors take actions you don't want them to.

## Installation

Once added as a GitHub Actions workflow, OctoGuide will automatically post comments advising users if their contribution activity violates any common best practices.
OctoGuide can scan comment, discussion, issue, and pull request events.

Add the following `.github/workflows/octoguide.yml` file to get started:

<Code
	code={getStartedBase}
	lang="yml"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

Once you've created that `.yml` file, congrats!
OctoGuide should be enabled on your repository.
👏

To test it out, try adding a comment with just the text _"+1"_ on an existing issue.
OctoGuide should post a response within 10-15 seconds.

## Configuration

### `config`

OctoGuide by default enables a _recommended_ set of rules.
You can extend it to use a _strict_ superset by adding `config: strict` to the action's `with`:

<Code
	code={getStartedStrict}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

The _strict_ config includes all rules from _recommended_ plus more rules that enforce more opinionated practices.

You can also use no config by setting `config: none` in the action's `with`:

<Code
	code={getStartedNone}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

The _none_ config includes no rules. Only rules explicitly enabled in the config will be enforced.

See [Preset Configs](./configs) for more information on preset configs and their rules.

### `github-token`

OctoGuide requires a `github-token` for the action to be able to post comments.
GitHub's provided `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` allows it to post as the general `github-actions[bot]`.

If you'd like the action to post as a different user, you can provide a token with permissions to comment on your repository.
For public repositories that's the following permissions:

- `repo` > `public_repo`
- `read:discussion`

### `include-bots`

OctoGuide by default skips running rules for bot-created entities (issues, pull requests, and discussions)
and comments. This is useful because automated tools like Dependabot, Renovate,
and other GitHub Apps often create PRs and issues or make comments that don't
necessarily need to follow the same contribution guidelines as human contributors.

Bot detection works by checking if the entity creator's `user.type` field is `"Bot"`,
which is the standard way GitHub identifies bot accounts and GitHub Apps.

If you want OctoGuide to run rules on bot-created entities and comments, you can
enable this by setting `include-bots` to `"true"`:

**Example:**

<Code
	code={getStartedIncludeBots}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

### `include-associations`

OctoGuide allows you to control which types of contributors have rules enforced on their
entities (issues, pull requests, and discussions) and comments based on their GitHub author association.
This is useful because repository collaborators and owners typically have a deeper understanding
of the project's contribution guidelines that external contributors may not have, and so might
not need to be included in checks such as for pull requests without backing issues.

The `include-associations` input accepts a comma-separated list of GitHub author associations
to include for rule checking. The default value excludes collaborators, organization members, and owners:

<Code
	code={getStartedIncludeAssociationsDefault}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

#### GitHub Author Associations

OctoGuide allows filtering on [GitHub's author associations](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#commentauthorassociation):

- `FIRST_TIMER` - First time committing to GitHub
- `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR` - First time committing to this repository
- `CONTRIBUTOR` - Previously committed to the repository
- `MEMBER` - Organization member
- `COLLABORATOR` - Repository collaborator
- `OWNER` - Repository owner
- `NONE` - No association (always included regardless of configuration)

The `NONE` association is always included automatically, even if you don't specify it,
ensuring that users with no association still have rules enforced.

#### Including collaborators and owners

If you want OctoGuide to run rules on everyone, including collaborators and owners,
you can specify all associations:

**Example:**

<Code
	code={getStartedIncludeCollaborators}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

#### Only first-time contributors

You can also be more selective. For example, to only check first-time contributors:

<Code
	code={getStartedIncludeFirstTimers}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

### `comment-header`

You can customize the header message that OctoGuide adds to its comments by providing a `comment-header` input as a string.

**Example:**

<Code
	code={getStartedHeader}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

If no custom header is provided, OctoGuide by default has no header message.

### `comment-footer`

You can customize the footer message that OctoGuide adds to its comments by providing a `comment-footer` input as a string.

**Example:**

<Code
	code={getStartedFooter}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

If no custom footer is provided, OctoGuide uses its default message.

### `rules`

You can enable or disable specific rules by providing a `rule` input set to a string equivalent to a JSON object.
Its keys should be the kebab-case rule names and values of booleans to enable or disable those rules.
This allows you to customize which rules are active beyond the preset configs.

**Examples:**

To disable a rule that's normally enabled in your chosen config:

<Code
	code={getStartedRuleDisable}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

To enable a rule that's not included in your chosen config:

<Code
	code={getStartedRuleEnable}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

To use only specific rules without any preset config:

<Code
	code={getStartedRuleNone}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

Rule names use kebab-case and correspond to the rule names shown in the [Rules](./rules) documentation.
When a rule is explicitly set via input, it takes precedence over the preset config settings.
