> Included in config: 🔒 strict

This repository enforces that pull request titles follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format.
Doing so helps to ensure that the purpose of a pull request is clear and consistent for humans and machines.

Specifically, keeping to the conventional commit format helps:

- Humans: it becomes easier to categorize and understand pull request purposes quickly
- Machines: automated tooling can parse those titles into semver-based releases

If a repository has this rule enabled, it's likely aiming for either or both of those benefits.

## Allowed Titles

This rule asks that titles be in either format:

```plaintext
type: body
type(scope): body
```

- `type`: the conventional commit type, such as `docs` or `fix`
- `scope`: an optional sub-area, commonly a package name if a monorepo
- `body`: a lower-case description

Example acceptable titles include:

```plaintext
docs: mention 'rick' feature in README.md
feat: add optional new 'roll' option to API
fix(parser): don't throw error on consecutive semicolons
```
