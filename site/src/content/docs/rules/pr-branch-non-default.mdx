Sending a PR from a repository's default branch, commonly `main`, means that repository will have a hard time pulling in updates from the upstream repository.
It's generally recommended to instead create a new branch per pull request.

## "Base" and "Head"

Two terms are useful to know when working with forked repositories and pull requests:

- **"Base"**: The main repository that receives the pull request.
  - Your local Git clone likely refers to this as _"upstream"_.
- **"Head"**: Your fork that is sending the pull request.
  - Your local Git clone likely refers to this as _"origin"_.

## Suggested Steps

GitHub does not provide a way to change the head branch of a pull request.
You'll want to:

1. Create a new branch on the head repository
2. Close the original pull request on GitHub
3. Send a new pull request from that branch

## Examples

[PR sent from a default `main` branch](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuideExamples/pull/8#issuecomment-2839484749):

<OctoGuideGitHubComment rule="pr-branch-non-default">
This PR is sent from the head repository's default branch.
Sending a PR from a default branch means the head repository can't easily be updated after the PR is merged.
Sending a PR from a repository's default branch, commonly <code>main</code>, means that repository will have a hard time pulling in updates from the upstream repository.
It's generally recommended to instead create a new branch per pull request.
You'll need to:

<ol>
	<li>Create a new branch on your fork</li>
	<li>Send a new pull request from that branch</li>
	<li>Close this pull request</li>
</ol>
</OctoGuideGitHubComment>
