OctoGuide also provides a standalone `octoguide` CLI you can run outside GitHub Actions.
`octoguide` can analyze a GitHub contribution and preview what rule violations that the OctoGuide action would report for it.
This CLI to use the same underlying [API](/generated/api) as also used in the [GitHub Action](https://octo.guide/get-started#installation).
