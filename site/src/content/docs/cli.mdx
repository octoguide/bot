OctoGuide also provides a standalone `octoguide` CLI you can run outside GitHub Actions.
`octoguide` can analyze a GitHub contribution and preview what rule violations that the OctoGuide action would report for it.

{/* TODO: Show a sample repository's issue with reports */}

<PackageManagers
	args="https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuide/issues/19"
	pkg="octoguide"
	type="dlx"
/>

```plaintext
Found 0 reports. Great! ✅
```

:::note
The `octoguide` CLI only logs pretty-printed reports back in your terminal.
It does not create comments or otherwise post any data to GitHub.

{/* TODO: Allow JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuide shorthand */}
{/* TODO: Allow OctoGuide shorthand if logged in */}

The `octoguide` CLI takes in one required positional argument for the activity to be scanned.
The activity can be provided as any of:

- Full URL: `npx octoguide https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuide/issues/19`
- **Coming soon:** Omitting the `https://github.com`: `npx octoguide JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuide/issues/19`
- **Coming soon:** Defaulting the author to your logged in CLI user: `npx octoguide OctoGuide/issues/19`

## Flags

### `--config`

Which [preset config](/configs) to use, as either:

- `recommended` _(default)_
- `strict`

```shell
npx octoguide JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuide/issues/19 --config strict
```

{/* TODO: Have the CLI default to reading `.github/actions/octoguide.yml` */}
{/* TODO: Have the CLI mention what config it inferred */}
